<h4>Project Title: Nablus Resilience: Economic, Educational, Psychological, Social (from October 7, 2023 to Present)</h4><br>
<p>Welcome to our comprehensive study focused specifically on Nablus,
the economic and educational hub of the Northern West Bank,
since the escalation of events on October 7, 2023.
Our project aims to document and visualize the profound impact of movement restrictions,
financial instability, and security constraints on daily life and institutional resilience.
</p><br>
<p>
Crucially, Nablus's history is defined by its steadfastness.
Despite facing immense economic contraction and daily disruption,
the city's educational core, especially An-Najah National University,
continues to develop and enhance learning, providing a beacon of hope and continuity.
</p><br>
<p>
The data presented across these pages reflects both the devastating economic
contraction and the institutional strength that enables academic life
to persist under extreme duress.
</p><br>
<p>
This immersive application serves as a dedicated resource to highlight
both the urgent humanitarian needs and the inspiring educational resilience in Nablus.
