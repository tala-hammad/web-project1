        <div class="content-info"><h1 class1="Unemployment-color">Unemployment</h1><br>Palestinian students have faced significant challenges in accessing quality and
        safe education
for decades. However, the escalation of violence following the events of October 7th have exacerbated 
this education crisis to unprecedented levels. In Gaza, the war has nearly destroyed the education system,
preventing almost all learning.
    Children in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have faced increasing violence and restrictions since 
    October 7th too, worsening existing challenges and creating new barriers for all 782,000 students.
    
    10 months into this crisis, the threats to the right to education for Palestinian students have never been
     so serious.</div>

A sharp decrease in Palestine's GDP in 2023 by
5.5% (1.9% in the West Bank and 22.6% in Gaza
Strip) due to the Israeli aggression against Gaza
Strip since October 7th, 2023. The Palestinian
economy in Gaza Strip collapsed, where it
declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2023
by 81.3% and its following repercussions on the
economy in the West Bank through the ongoing
tightening, closure and continuous raids into
the West Bank governorates, in addition to
forbidding Palestinian workers from joining
their workplaces in Israel. This is in addition
to the decline in international aid, the sharp
decrease in external budgetary support, and the
Israeli unilateral deductions from the clearance
revenues it collects on behalf of Palestine.
Thus, adding another setback to the deepening
chronic fiscal crisis; which detrimentally
impedes the government’s ability to meet its
financial commitments towards its Palestinian
society.

The right to education is enshrined in international law, including the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Geneva Conventions. However, 
Palestinian students have faced significant challenges in accessing quality and safe education for decades.
These challenges include violence targeting of teachers and students, Israeli military operations and raids in 
and around schools, settler violence, destruction of educational facilities, movement restrictions, 
and bureaucratic impediments. In recent years, Palestinian students have also experienced significant learning
 losses due to restrictions introduced to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and a year-long teachers’ strike due 
 to salary payment delays.

The events following October 7th have exacerbated this existing education crisis to unprecedented levels,
 with severe disruptions due to movement restrictions, military operations and settler violence,
  affecting at least 782,000 students across the West Bank. All schools run by the Palestinian Authority 
  (PA) in the West Bank have adopted a hybrid model, combining face-to-face and distance learning.
   This shift is primarily due to access constraints, protection risks, and economic pressures,
    which have intensified since October 2023 and led to significantly reduced salary payments for education 
    staff. While UNRWA schools remain operational, they have occasionally closed due to the ongoing escalation 
    of violence. Additionally, many out-of-school children are now reportedly engaging in child labour, 
    a coping strategy to support household income during economic crisis. In Gaza, the war has nearly destroyed
     the education system, preventing education since October 7th.

In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the current crisis has worsened existing challenges and created
 new barriers. 10 months into this crisis, the right to education for Palestinian students remains severely 
 threatened.
