<p><b>Psychological Aspect in Nablus (2022–2023)

The psychological situation in Nablus during 2022 and 2023 was heavily influenced by economic pressure, social instability, and limited opportunities for youth. Many residents experienced increased levels of stress, anxiety, and emotional fatigue as they dealt with uncertainty in daily life. Families faced financial strain, which often contributed to tension at home and reduced overall well-being.

Young people were among the most affected. The high unemployment rate—especially the 48% unemployment among university graduates—led to feelings of frustration, hopelessness, and fear about the future. Many students and graduates reported decreased motivation, difficulty focusing, and concerns about long-term stability.<br><br>
    
Women also experienced distinct psychological challenges due to higher unemployment levels, social expectations, and limited economic participation. These factors contributed to increased emotional stress and reduced access to support networks.<br><br>

Environmental instability, mobility restrictions, and occasional disruptions in the city added another layer of psychological pressure. These conditions affected sleep patterns, concentration, and overall mental health for many households.<br><br>

Despite these challenges, the people of Nablus demonstrated strong emotional resilience. Community support, family bonds, and social solidarity played a major role in helping individuals cope with stress. Local organizations, universities, and social centers made efforts to provide counseling, awareness programs, and safe spaces for young people to express their concerns and seek guidance.<br><br>

Overall, the psychological landscape in Nablus during 2022–2023 reflected a mix of stress and resilience, shaped by the city’s economic conditions, social pressures, and strong community ties.
