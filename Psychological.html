    The protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict has left an indelible mark on the mental health of Palestinian children and adolescents. Being one of the most vulnerable populations, 
    these young individuals face heightened exposure to war-related trauma.
     On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale attack on Israel, triggering sustained military operations across the West Bank. 
     This escalation resulted in unprecedented violence in the North and Middle regions, including intensified airstrikes, ground incursions, mass arrests, 
     and displacement of civilians—creating new layers of trauma for children .<br><br>

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental health condition characterized by intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, cognitive distortions, and hyperarousal that severely impair functioning .
 Children in conflict zones show alarmingly high PTSD rates (25%–70%) depending on exposure intensity , with symptoms manifesting
  as academic decline, social withdrawal, sleep disturbances, and behavioral problems . 
  In Palestine specifically, continuous conflict and socioeconomic hardships compound mental health challenges, while limited-service access creates critical treatment gaps .<br><br>

Sociodemographic factors influence PTSD vulnerability, though findings show inconsistencies. Some studies associate older age, female gender, and urban residence with higher risk ,
 while others report nonsignificant effects of gender and age .
  These discrepancies highlight the presence of context-dependent mediators that require localized investigation.<br><br>

Traumatic events like witnessing violence, bereavement, or displacement are established PTSD triggers .
 Recent Syrian research identified family member deaths and home destruction as particularly devastating , 
 while West Bank studies link military operations to symptom exacerbation . Evidence-based interventions like trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) show efficacy in post-conflict settings , 
 though substantial adaptations are needed during ongoing violence  and therapeutic respite may facilitate engagement.<br><br>

This study addresses critical gaps by assessing PTSD prevalence and severity following the October 2023 escalation, analyzing associations with age, gender, and residence,
 examining functional impairments across academic, social, and familial domains, and investigating trauma type–dose relationships. 
 The findings will directly inform school-based mental health programs and adapted 
 clinical interventions tailored to the ongoing crisis context .
