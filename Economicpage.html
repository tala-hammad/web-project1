<p><b>Unemployment rates with the beginning of
the Israeli aggression against Gaza Strip in the
fourth quarter of 2023 recorded unprecedented
levels, especially in Gaza Strip. Unemployment
rate in Palestine increased to 46.1%, exceeding
its percentage of 30% in the West Bank
compared to 75% in Gaza Strip. Also, the
size of the labour force in the fourth quarter
of 2023 decreased by 3.8% compared to the
previous quarter. As a result, unemployment
rates increased in Palestine to reach 30.7% in
2023 compared to 25.5% in 2022. The number
of unemployed individuals reached 446
thousand in 2023, where unemployment rate in
Gaza Strip reached 52.8% compared to 17.9%
in the West Bank in 2023. The percentage of
labour force participants decreased to 44.1%
compared with 45.4% in 2022. Percentage of
labour force varied between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip in 2023, reaching 46.9% in the West
Bank, compared to 40.1% in Gaza Strip.</b></p>
<p><b><br><br>
  A sharp decrease in Palestine's GDP in 2023 by
5.5% (1.9% in the West Bank and 22.6% in Gaza
Strip) due to the Israeli aggression against Gaza
Strip since October 7th, 2023. The Palestinian
economy in Gaza Strip collapsed, where it
declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2023
by 81.3% and its following repercussions on the
economy in the West Bank through the ongoing
tightening, closure and continuous raids into
the West Bank governorates, in addition to
forbidding Palestinian workers from joining
their workplaces in Israel. This is in addition
to the decline in international aid, the sharp
decrease in external budgetary support, and the
Israeli unilateral deductions from the clearance
revenues it collects on behalf of Palestine.
Thus, adding another setback to the deepening
chronic fiscal crisis; which detrimentally
impedes the government’s ability to meet its
financial commitments towards its Palestinian
society.
